                  . I started meditating about one year ago and have learned how
                  to be more focused, mindful, and relaxed. So far, I've
                  meditated for a total of 1,385 minutes, and I am continuing to
                  grow this number every day!

                  I had never been much of a reader until this year. When
                  quarantine started, I thought it'd be a great opportunity to
                  get into reading and find books I really enjoy. I've read 7
                  books since March and can't wait to read more. Check out what
                  I've been reading on{' '}

                  I first picked up a soccer ball when I was 4 years old and
                  have played the beautiful game since. I played competitively
                  for FC Dallas, while also playing for my high school soccer
                  team. In college, I play intramural soccer and frequently look
                  for pick-up games to play!

                  I am a big foodie! Growing up with a mom who cooks the best
                  Persian food, I fell in love with food at an early age. I'm
                  currently working on a cookbook of all my mom's original
                  recipes and am learning more about cooking too. I love trying
                  new restaurants and recipes!
